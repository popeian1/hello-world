<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

<!--
Similarly to how it was instructed in class, I used Copilot to generate a well-formed HTML 
file that displays "Hello World!" as a heading. (It also generated a title as well, and I
decided to keep it). I then asked Copilot to explain to me what the !DOCTYPE tag does
as well as the lang and charset attributes so I know more about the structure of the 
language itself.
